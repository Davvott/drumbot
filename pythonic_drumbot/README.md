Davvott's version of DrumBot utilizes python sonic and the pretty cool Sonic Pi.

Sonic Pi seems pretty awesome, check it out if you're into that kind of thing. 


## v1.1
Just some basic code to call from drumbot/ and play the sounds. 

Took me a while, but I'm stoked I did it. 

Make sure you have python-sonic installed, and have download and installed Sonic Pi.
# * If there's no sound - run Sonic Pi! *
